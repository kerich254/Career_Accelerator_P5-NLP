# ðŸš€ Friendly Web Interface for ML Projects with Gradio ðŸš€

There are many ways to make web interfaces to allow interaction with Machine Learning models and we will cover one of them.

# Introduction
COVID-19 virus is a disease pandemic that claimed the lives of a lot of people. However scientists have really tried to invent vaccines against the virus. The vaccines may or may not be 100% effective to curb the virus.

There has been a lot stories going on the public regarding the safety of the Covid -19 Vaccines. This has brought a lot on debate on the social media channels and one of the popular channel is Twitter. There has been major concern as a Data Scientist, to annalyze these tweets and find important insights that will guide the governments, the scientists and researchers towards discovering the best vaccines that will be safe, effective and trustful to the general public.

## Project Description
To achieve this, we deploy the Sentiment Analysis towards tweets on Covid-19 vaccines.By achieving this , we leverage pre-trained models from Huggingface. The models have been trained, fine-tuned using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The analysis can be used to determine wether the sentiments are : 1) Positive, 2)Neutral or 3) Negative
